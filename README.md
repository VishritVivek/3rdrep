Task 1 :
EXPLANATION : 
1 : For a python programme that tells the factorial of the inputed number i have set up a variable ' num ' that holds inputed number 
2 : Next , i have defined a fuction named factorial () that functions an if and else condition 
3 : According to which , if 'n' represention the inputed number in the given funtion is greater or equal to 2 the programme returns the factorial of the given number using factorial formula syntax n*(factorial(n-1)) 
4 : Else the programme returns the factorial as 1

Task 2 : 
EXPLANTION : 
1 : For a python programme that calculate and provides the LOG , SINE and SQUARE ROOT of the inputed number i have imported mathematical function like log , sin and sqrt from math 
2 : Next , a variable 'num' that holds the inputed number in float is set up 
3 : A fuction named 'square()' is defined in which using print syntax and formula '(sqrt(n))'the square root is given as an output 
4 : Next , a function named 'loga()' is defined n which the natural logarithm is given as output using print syntax and formula '(log(m))
5 : Next , a function named 'sine()' is defined in which the sine of the number is given as output using print syntax adn formula '(sin(o))'
these are then printed to complete the programme
